# :boom: EXPRESS TEMPLATE

A template for an [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) application, built upon the output of [express-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator).

### How to use

Click the green "Use this template" button above.

By default no templating engine is included. One can be easily added if required. Popular engines include [Pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug), [Mustache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache), [Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars) and [EJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs).

### Motivation

- Using GitHub repository templates to provide a simple way to create an express app without having to download and use a CLI tool
- A preference for ES6 syntax (e.g. `const` instead of `var`, arrow functions for callbacks)
- Included `.gitignore` file for node applications
- Updated & audited dependency packages

### Contributing

Contributions of any description are welcomed, particularly for keeping dependencies up to date.
